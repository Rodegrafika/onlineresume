A commissioned project for a Portfolio Website, created with HTML5 and CSS3 based on Bootstrap library and animation through Javascript and JQuery.
Actually, I'm transferring it to a Wordpress platform with custom WP Theme created from scratch without changing the design. this choice will improve the User Experience through the WP interface and give the client the possibility of updating content easily and more frequently.
