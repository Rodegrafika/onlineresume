###Commissioned work for a voice therapy facility
<br>

### How is it built
Basic web presence based on Wordpress with child-theme and other customized feature.

###What I've learned
The biggest part of the work was to adapt the style to the client wish using CSS and dealing with cross-browser compatibility. The client has a lot of user with an old browser and it was challenging to find a way to guarantee good user experience to most of the visitors.
