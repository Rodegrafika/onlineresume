###Javascript version of the popular dice game
<br>

### How is it built
Vanilla Javascript, styled with CSS.

###What I've learned
It was mainly about DOM manipulation and user interaction through Javascript. 


###What can I improve
I could add more player or the number of dices in order to give more complexity to the game. It could also be transformed in a app with log-in functions and the possibility to keep count of the scores, eventually save the information in a JSON file or connect to a database.
