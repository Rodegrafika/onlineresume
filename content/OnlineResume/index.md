###Online Resume

 Built with Node.js using Javascript libraries such as React.js and Gatsby.js.
 The main data about the works are provided through Markdown files and queried thought GraphQL.

###What I've learned
 With this project, I learn hot to work with gatsby.js and practice my react skills, also learn to use GraphQL to query data from different sources. I also get to know better how to manage packages and plug-in with NPM.
