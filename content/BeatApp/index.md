###Frontend application to play beats with the keyboard 


#### How is it built
The App is written in vanilla Javascript. Sound is provided with the <a href=https://howlerjs.com/>howler.js</a> library and the animation through <a href="http://paperjs.org/"> paper.js</a>.


####What I've learned
Through this project, I learned DOM manipulation through Javascript, the use of algorithms and how to use extern Javascript libraries.
