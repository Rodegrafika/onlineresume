Javascript application where the user can play a beat by clicking a letter in the keyboard, the click will also produce a random animation, a colored circle.
Sound is provided with the <a href=https://howlerjs.com/>howler.js</a> library and the animation through <a href="http://paperjs.org/"> paper.js</a>.
Through this project, I learned DOM manipulation through Javascript, the use of algorithms and how to use extern Javascript libraries.
