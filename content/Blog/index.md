###Microblog Application 

#### How is it built
The application is written in PHP7 and connected to a MySQL Database. 
The user can create a post with a little text and a link. 
There are registration and login functions and passwords are encrypted.

####What I've learned
The project was an introduction of the main concepts concerning Object-Oriented Programming in PHP7. 
It also provides me a basic knowledge of creating an managing a SQL Database with myPhpAdmin.
