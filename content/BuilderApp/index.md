###React App simulating a Burger Shop (part of an online boot camp about react.js)
<br>

### How is it built
The App simulated a burger shop, where the costumers can build their own burger. With price calculation and check out function. It is built with react.js, written in JSX, and the graphic is provided with CSS. 


###What I've learned
The project, that is still a work in progress, is a basic react app, created to explore the main concepts of programming an app with react, understanding the structure, creating layout components, working with stateful and stateless components, dynamic outputting data. The next steps will be routing, improving performance, and adding Redux.
