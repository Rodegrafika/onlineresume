###React App simulating a Burger Shop (part of an online boot camp)

 Built with react.js, written in JSX, and the graphic is provided with CSS. Work in progress.

###What I've learned
 The project, that is still a work in progress, is a basic react app, created to explore the main concepts of programming an app with react, understanding the structure, creating layout components, working with stateful and stateless components, dynamic outputting data. The next steps will be routing, improving performance, and adding Redux.
