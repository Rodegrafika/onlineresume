###RGB Guess game

 Written in Javascript and styled with CSS. 
 The user has to guess which color correspond to the random provided RGB code. 
 The game hat three levels of difficulty and a reset (new color) button.

###What I've learned
 With this project, I practice Javascript DOM manipulation and game logic with simple algorithms and animations.
